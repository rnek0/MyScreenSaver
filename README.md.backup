# MyScreenSaver

Jack Sparrow screen saver is just a C# fun project that I have make for my PC.

It works on several screens with an image and gives the time.

An implementation inspired by [the work of Frank McCown](https://sites.harding.edu/fmccown/screensaver/screensaver.html) - February 22, 2012 .

Enjoy.
